# IssueManager
Built in Eclipse using Java. This program functions as a finite state machine to track user created issues. A user can create an issue as a "bug" or an "enhancement". Each issue can exist in one of 5 states (New, Working, Confirmed, Verifying, Closed). An issue contains an id, summary, owner, and other data such as resolution or confirmation status. 
User is able to send an issue to different states based on certain criteria.


Previous Git commit history is located inside the logs folder, then opening the HEAD file.
